Thank you for making our monthly meetup a grand success. With over 40 attendees from all over Andhra Pradesh, and extraodrinary spirit that the attendees brought to the table, we have made it more than just successfull. With this spirit, we have a lot of things to work on in the coming month, before we meet again in the month of April.
