Driven by the spirit of collaboration, GDG Vizag's Open Source wing is your local hub for all things open source. We're a community of enthusiasts, from beginners to experienced developers, who believe in the power of shared knowledge and collective contribution.  We host events, workshops, and projects to help you learn about, use, and contribute to open source. Let's build the future of tech, openly!

We are planning to host monthly meetups as we go forward and would be happy to have your participation there as well. You know what's more interesting? We would be delighted if you want to speak at the meetup and share your knowledge.
